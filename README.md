# PubSemWebBiblissimaMSS
This repository contains the template and dtd of Biblissima's Pivot XML - defined for :
  1/ internal data export from the projects different databases about the provenance of books 
  and for 
  2/ data ingestion into the Semantic-Web-Application framework CubicWeb.

The data ingestion is realised in 5 separated phases, based on the spezialisation of the databases : 
  a/ provenance 
  b/ history of textes 
  c/ iconographic databases 
  d/ inventories 
  e/ some transcriptions of texts.

Currently we treat the following databases :
  Bibale
  CRII
  Esprit des Livres
  Europeana Regia.

Template and the dtd are adapted to these needs and will continue to evolve.
